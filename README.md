# LinkedIn Post Formatter

A web-based tool that helps you create eye-catching LinkedIn posts with special formatting options like bold text, italics, bullet points, arrows, and more.

## Features

- **Rich Text Formatting**: Add bold text, italics, bullet points, arrows, and separators to your LinkedIn posts
- **Emoji Picker**: Quickly insert emojis into your posts
- **Post Templates**: Choose from pre-designed templates for common LinkedIn post types
- **Real-time Preview**: See how your post will look on LinkedIn as you type
- **Character Counter**: Keep track of your post length (LinkedIn has a 3,000 character limit)
- **One-Click Copy**: Easily copy your formatted post to paste into LinkedIn

LinkedIn doesn't support rich text formatting natively, but this tool uses special Unicode characters to simulate formatting effects that will display correctly when pasted into LinkedIn.
